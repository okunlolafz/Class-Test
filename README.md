# **Class Test Program**

## **Description:**
This program processes student marks stored in an external file named "MARKS.txt" and generates output to an external file named "Output.txt." The program calculates the average marks of students and determines the number of students who passed the test.

## **Usage:**
1. Ensure the "MARKS.txt" file contains the marks of students, each on a separate line.
2. Run the program by executing the provided Fortran code.
3. The program will read the marks from "MARKS.txt," perform calculations, and generate output in the "Output.txt" file.

## **Output Format:**
- The program outputs the average marks of students and the number of students who passed.

## **Note:**
- The program uses file handling to read input from "MARKS.txt" and write output to "Output.txt."
- Marks are processed to calculate the average, and students with marks greater than or equal to 5 are considered to have passed.

## **About:**
The Class Test Program showcases basic file handling, array processing, and conditional logic to analyze student marks. It provides a practical example of processing external data in Fortran.
